### Vercel Deployment

#### Step-by-Step Vercel UI Deployment Guide

1. **Prepare Your Repository**
   - Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository
   - Your repository should contain all the files from this project

2. **Sign Up/Log In to Vercel**
   - Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
   - Click "Sign Up" or "Log In" in the top right corner
   - You can sign up with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for easier integration

3. **Create a New Project**
   - After logging in, click the "New Project" button
   - If this is your first time, you'll see a "Create a New Project" option

4. **Import Your Git Repository**
   - Under "Import Git Repository", you'll see your GitHub repositories
   - Find and select your portfolio repository
   - Click "Import"

5. **Configure Project Settings**
   - Vercel will automatically detect this is a Vite project
   - Verify the following settings:
     - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
     - **Output Directory**: `dist`
     - **Install Command**: `npm install`
   - These should be automatically filled in, but verify they match

6. **Deploy Your Project**
   - Click the "Deploy" button
   - Vercel will now:
     - Clone your repository
     - Install dependencies
     - Run the build command
     - Deploy your site

7. **View Your Deployment**
   - The deployment process will take 1-3 minutes
   - You'll see a live URL (e.g., `your-project-name.vercel.app`)
   - Click "Go to Dashboard" to view deployment details

8. **Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - In your project dashboard, go to "Settings" → "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow the DNS configuration instructions

#### Vercel Configuration

This project includes a `vercel.json` file that configures:
- Route rewrites for client-side routing (essential for React Router)
- Cache headers for static assets
- Security headers for enhanced protection
- Build settings for the static site generator

Note: The configuration uses the newer Vercel syntax where `rewrites` and `headers` are used instead of the legacy `routes` property to avoid conflicts.

### Alternative Vercel CLI Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy using the CLI:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
   
   Or use the project script:
   ```bash
   npm run vercel-deploy
   ```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

1. **Case Sensitivity Errors**
   - **Problem**: `Could not resolve "../components/ParallaxBackground" from "src/sections/Hero.jsx"`
   - **Solution**: Ensure file names match exactly, including case. The file is named `parallaxBackground.jsx` (lowercase 'p'), not `ParallaxBackground.jsx`.
   - **Why**: Linux file systems (used by Vercel) are case-sensitive, while Windows is not.

2. **Routing Issues**
   - **Problem**: 404 errors when navigating to pages directly
   - **Solution**: The `vercel.json` includes rewrite rules to serve `index.html` for all routes, enabling client-side routing.

3. **Asset Loading Issues**
   - **Problem**: Images or other assets not loading
   - **Solution**: Ensure all assets are in the `public` directory and referenced with correct paths starting with `/`
